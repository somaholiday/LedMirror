LED Mirror
==========

An LED mirror project built for the [Gray Area 2016 Creative Code Youth Apprenticeship with NOW Hunters Point](http://grayarea.org/workshop/2016-creative-code-youth-apprenticeship-now-hunters-point/)

The project runs on a Raspberry Pi 3, using Processing and PixelPusher, with LPD8806 LEDs.  It consists of a framed LED screen that uses the Raspberry Pi Camera V2 as input, and apprentice-written Processing sketches that manipulate the input to produce output on the LED "mirror".
